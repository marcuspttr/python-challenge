Initial commit:

  - Had to drag and drop the CSV files to copy into the respective Resource folders.

Second commit:
- Wrote code for PyBank bank accounting problem.
- Was able to solve the required analysis; however, not very pleased with how I solved for the Average Change.
- Had to move CSV data for bank into the main folder as I could not get the proper reference for filepath:
  - I want it to be filepath = os.path.join('..','Resources','budget_data.csv') but it was not registering.
