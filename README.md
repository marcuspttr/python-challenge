Practice in python coding reading csv files to help a bank with accounting and a polling station with results.

8/23/2021
Initial commit:
- Cloned repository to personal computer.
- Added PyBank and PyPoll folders.
  - Within each added: Resource & analysis folders as well as a main.py for the code.
  - Had to drag and drop the CSV files to copy into the respective Resource folders.

Second commit:
- Wrote code for PyBank bank accounting problem.
- Was able to solve the required analysis; however, not very pleased with how I solved for the Average Change.
- Had to move CSV data for bank into the main folder as I could not get the proper reference for filepath:
  - I want it to be filepath = os.path.join('..','Resources','budget_data.csv') but it was not registering.

Fifth commit:
- Added jupyter files to practice reading and writing data with pandas.
- VERY rough copy so far, working on chunking the data and need to look into how to read through the rows to grab data (if that is even the proper approach).

Sixth commit:
- Fixed the opening text for files. Possibly. Seems like it's too specific to my computer.
- Jupyter and Pandas in general was much easier and cleaner to work with, although I wasn't sure how to translate each calculation I had done with just Python.
